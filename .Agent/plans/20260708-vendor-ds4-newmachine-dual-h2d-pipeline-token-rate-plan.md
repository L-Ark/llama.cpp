# Vendor DeepSeek New-Machine Dual-H2D Pipeline Token-Rate Plan

## Summary

Continue optimizing vendor DeepSeek on branch `vendor/deepseek-token-rate-16gb`
for the product target: random user prompts should produce stable `>5 tok/s`
on a 16GB host-RAM machine with a 32GB RTX 5090.

This plan explicitly covers both new-machine hardware states:

- **Case A, pre-cable / low-H2D:** effective H2D around `6.6 GB/s`, cold
  generalized result around `2.5-3.0 tok/s`.
- **Case B, post-cable / improved x4:** PCIe can reach `32 GT/s x4`, H2D
  around `11.5 GB/s`, cold generalized result around `3.0 tok/s`.

Old-machine `4.9 tok/s` remains an x16 reference, not the new-machine baseline.
All accepted results must be prompt-general, strict-cold, reproducible, and
within the 16GB cgroup including page cache.

## Required Pre-Run Procedure

Before every official cold benchmark, profile run, or SOTA validation on the new
machine:

1. Stop display usage so VRAM is not consumed by graphical processes:

   ```bash
   echo '12345678' | sudo -S systemctl stop display-manager || true
   pkill -f gnome-shell || true
   pkill -f '/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg' || true
   ```

2. Confirm `nvidia-smi` shows no running GPU processes and only driver-reserved
   VRAM remains.
3. Set CPU policy to performance:

   ```bash
   echo '12345678' | sudo -S bash -lc '
     for f in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do
       echo performance > "$f" 2>/dev/null || true
     done
     for f in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference; do
       echo performance > "$f" 2>/dev/null || true
     done
   '
   ```

4. Record PCIe link state and H2D benchmark before the cold run:
   `current_link_speed`, `current_link_width`, `max_link_speed`,
   `max_link_width`, plus 4.25MiB pinned H2D throughput.

Runs that skip the display-process cleanup are diagnostic only and must not be
promoted as SOTA.

## Current Evidence And Bottleneck

- The SOTA path is active on the new machine: gate full native expert pack,
  full GGUF alias TSV, up/down paired reads, `misses=0`, and strict 16GB cgroup
  accounting all work.
- Expert IO is not the primary bottleneck. `iouring_reads=8194` and
  `iouring_bytes≈36.5GB` match old-machine runs, and IO wait is not enough to
  explain the token-rate gap.
- H2D is the largest measured hardware-linked gap:
  - pre-cable new machine: about `6.6 GB/s`
  - post-cable new machine: about `11.5 GB/s`
  - old x16 reference: about `26-28 GB/s`
- New-machine CPU utilization remains low because threads mostly wait on
  H2D/CUDA/io_uring/staging events. Forcing CUDA spin and `--poll 100` did not
  close the gap, so the next software work must reduce bytes, reduce copy
  count, and overlap more work rather than only changing thread polling.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Baseline and metadata recording**
   - Record separate baselines for Case A and Case B. Never compare or promote
     results without stating the hardware case.
   - Every run artifact must include command/env, commit, model path, expert
     pack path, alias TSV, answer text, cgroup memory stats, PCIe link, H2D
     benchmark, MoE counters, and whether display processes were stopped.

2. **Two-stage gate/up/down aggregation**
   - After router selection, collect all current-layer gate/up/down expert read
     requests before submitting IO.
   - Sort requests by source offset and submit them as one aggregated plan.
   - Keep default behavior unchanged; gate with env such as
     `GGML_MOE_GATE_UPDOWN_AGGREGATE=1`.
   - Fallback to the current path on any unsupported dtype, pack miss, alias
     miss, short read, or correctness risk.

3. **Larger H2D batching / copy coalescing**
   - Combine adjacent or same-batch staging buffers into fewer H2D submissions
     where tensor layout and kernel inputs remain unchanged.
   - Add profile fields for H2D copy count, total H2D bytes, H2D ms, average
     copy size, and per-token H2D wait.
   - This is expected to help Case A most, but should also reduce wait overhead
     in Case B.

4. **Reduce H2D bytes with compact or partial up/down source**
   - First produce a hard-bound profile: actual rows/blocks used per
     token/layer, full-expert bytes copied, partial-copy bytes needed, and
     projected token-rate upper bound for Case A and Case B.
   - Only implement a default-off compact source if the bound shows meaningful
     gain. It must not replace the native full expert pack or rely on a
     prompt-specific profile.

5. **Prompt-general VRAM cache admission**
   - Use only calibration/dev prompts for tuning. Held-out prompts are final
     test only.
   - Improve gate/up/down split-pool and admission behavior to reduce misses
     without hurting the gate fullpack path.
   - Reject any candidate that improves France only or reduces generalized
     correctness.

6. **Non-expert mmap/page-cache pressure**
   - Profile decode-stage major faults and `memory.stat file/anon` for dense,
     attention, norm, and other non-expert tensors.
   - Try default-off page retention or pre-touch only if it remains inside the
     16GB cgroup and does not raise TTFT beyond the gate.

## Validation And Promotion

Use the calibration/dev set for tuning:

- `Please introduce France in a short paragraph.`
- `Explain quantum computing briefly.`
- `Write a short Python function for Fibonacci.`
- `Introduce Japan in a short paragraph.`
- `Summarize climate change in one paragraph.`
- `AI infra 是做什么的`
- `How to deploy a large model on a small devices?`
- `今天吃什么`

Held-out prompts must only be used after a candidate is frozen.

Promotion requirements:

- Strict cold run with `MemoryMax=16000000000`, `MemorySwapMax=0`, and
  `drop_caches`.
- Display processes stopped before the run and verified absent from
  `nvidia-smi`.
- RAM and page cache within the 16GB cgroup; no swap/OOM/ram kill.
- France output and generalized prompt outputs are coherent and semantically
  correct.
- TTFT is not more than 20% above the corresponding hardware-case baseline.
- Token rate exceeds the corresponding hardware-case baseline and reproduces in
  at least two cold repeats.
- Accepted improvements must be committed and pushed immediately to
  `ssd/vendor/deepseek-token-rate-16gb` with reproduction details. Use
  `L-Ark <fliangae@connect.ust.hk>` for commits.

## Assumptions

- Current active new-machine state is Case B, post-cable Gen5 x4 H2D around
  `11.5 GB/s`.
- Case A is retained as a supported low-H2D scenario for bound analysis and
  future weak-link machines.
- Old-machine x16 `4.9 tok/s` is a reference ceiling source, not the baseline
  for new-machine SOTA promotion.
- All new runtime behavior must be default-off until generalized validation is
  complete.
- Kimi functionality must not be removed or weakened when touching shared MoE or
  CUDA streaming code.

## 2026-07-08 Execution Notes

- Added run-artifact hardware metadata collection to
  `scripts/demo-vendor-ds4-general-sota.sh`: display-process status, GPU state,
  PCIe link state, and 4.25MiB pinned H2D benchmark are now recorded in each run
  summary.
- New-machine run `20260708T131124Z-caseB-metadata-baseline` validated the new
  metadata path under strict cold cgroup. It was RAM/correctness compliant but
  only reached `2.8 tok/s`; H2D measured `6.71 GB/s`, so the machine was in the
  low-H2D Case A-like state despite the post-cable setup.
- Existing `GGML_MOE_GATE_UPDOWN_COSUBMIT=1` was re-tested as a default-off
  aggregation probe on the new machine. It was rejected: `2.7 tok/s`, more total
  expert traffic (`39.5GB` vs baseline `36.5GB`), and no SOTA improvement.
- Gate one-cache split probes were rejected:
  - `GGML_MOE_STREAM_ONE_CACHE_MIB=5120`: `2.7 tok/s`
  - `GGML_MOE_STREAM_ONE_CACHE_MIB=7168`: `2.6 tok/s`
- Prompt-general VRAM profile probes using
  `calib-dev-sparse-pair-top512-updown-20260707` were rejected:
  - protected preload increased runtime misses to `8811` and produced
    `2.6 tok/s`;
  - profile-only `profile_lfu_lru` increased misses to `14491`, produced
    `2.2 tok/s`, and showed worse output quality.
- Updated conclusion: old preload/admission paths are not the next route to
  `>5 tok/s` on the new machine. The next implementation must directly reduce
  H2D bytes or H2D submissions, or implement a true shared gate/up/down read
  aggregation layer that does not increase total reads.
- Added default-off profiling hooks for the real current hot paths:
  - `GGML_MOE_H2D_COALESCE_PROFILE_OUT` records whether batch io_uring H2D
    copies are physically coalescible.
  - `GGML_MOE_ONE_PACK_READ_PROFILE_OUT` records `moe_stream` one-pack direct
    reads: tensor, expert, offset, bytes, O_DIRECT status, and read latency.
- Diagnostic run `20260708T132817Z-h2d-coalesce-profile` proved the current
  generalized new-machine path does **not** enter the batch
  `expert_pack_iouring_copy_jobs` H2D path for the dominant gate reads; no H2D
  coalesce CSV was produced. The hot gate source is `moe_stream` one expert
  pack, while up/down still shows `down parallel CPU staging active`.
- Diagnostic run `20260708T133227Z-one-pack-read-profile` produced:
  - `eval_tok_s=2.1`, diagnostic only because per-read CSV adds overhead;
  - `memory_peak_bytes=14901284864`, `ram_ok=true`,
    `display_processes_stopped_before_run=true`;
  - H2D benchmark `6.68 GB/s`, PCIe under load `16.0 GT/s x4`;
  - one-pack gate reads: `7701` reads, `34.32GB`, total direct-read wall
    `7445 ms`, avg `0.967 ms`, p50 `0.778 ms`, p95 `1.200 ms`;
  - consecutive physical-offset continuity only `162/7700 = 2.1%`.
- Consequence: simple adjacent-read or adjacent-H2D coalescing in the current
  execution order is not enough. The next implementation should prioritize:
  1. locating the up/down miss source that bypasses batch io_uring and moving it
     onto an expert-pack/batch path;
  2. changing gate/up/down scheduling to submit a known per-layer route group
     together, rather than trying to merge the already-issued read order;
  3. restoring larger effective VRAM cache allocation on the new machine. The
     diagnostic runs requested `9GB` batch VRAM cache but fell back to `6.9GB`,
     so cache pressure is worse than intended.
- Root-caused one new-machine-specific regression: the committed static GGUF
  alias TSV contained the old-machine model path
  `/root/lfz/models/.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-FP4-FP8-native.gguf`. On the new
  machine this produced `expert alias source: open failed`, so up/down misses
  fell back to mmap host staging/page cache instead of batch io_uring.
- Implemented a run-local alias rewrite in
  `scripts/demo-vendor-ds4-general-sota.sh`: each artifact now contains
  `ds4-native-full-gguf-alias-source.effective.tsv`, generated from the static
  prompt-general alias TSV but with `source_path` set to the current `MODEL`.
  This is machine-path repair only, not prompt-specific optimization.
- Validation run `20260708T133916Z-effective-alias-fix` on prompt
  `How to deploy a large model on small devices?`:
  - `eval_tok_s=2.5` vs `2.2` before the alias fix on the same prompt;
  - `prompt_tok_s=3.2`, `TTFT=19050.8 ms`, elapsed `55.57s`;
  - `memory_peak_bytes=14610792448`, `memory_file_bytes=13723795456`,
    `ram_ok=true`, display processes stopped;
  - H2D benchmark `6.73 GB/s`, PCIe under load `16.0 GT/s x4`;
  - batch expert source restored:
    `expert alias source: io_uring direct reads enabled`,
    `iouring_reads=9416`, `iouring_bytes=41961914368`, `misses=0`;
  - batch VRAM cache improved to `hits=24151`, `misses=9416`,
    `hit_rate=71.9%`;
  - model answer was semantically correct and coherent, but truncated by the
    `n=96` demo cap.
- This is an accepted reproducibility/performance fix for the new machine but
  not a product SOTA: generalized random-prompt target remains `>5 tok/s`, and
  this single-prompt new-machine run is only `2.5 tok/s`.
